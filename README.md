# Overview
This was my first assignment when I started my Internship at FPT Software.

The goal is to learn C Coding Conventions, how to write clean code and easy to understand for everyone. Also how to write Makefile to compile C files to executable file.

# How to use
- Make sure you have gcc and Chocolatey installed if you are using Windows.

**Note that this Makefile was written to run on Windows**
```bash
make all # To compile .exe
make run # Compile and run .exe file 
make clean # Clean up all compiled file
```
